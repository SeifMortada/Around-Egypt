## 📌 Overview

**Around Egypt** is an Android app that lets users explore various experiences across Egypt. The app displays recent and recommended experiences on the home screen, where users can like experiences and search for specific ones. When a user likes an experience, the like count updates automatically, and views are also tracked. Clicking on an experience opens the detail screen, showing full details and allowing users to like it from there as well.
