## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Around Egypt** is an Android app that lets users explore various experiences across Egypt. The app displays recent and recommended experiences on the home screen, where users can like experiences and search for specific ones. When a user likes an experience, the like count updates automatically, and views are also tracked. Clicking on an experience opens the detail screen, showing full details and allowing users to like it from there as well.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is structured into modules for better organization:

- **core**: Contains shared components like networking, database, repositories, mappers, and dependency injection setup.
- **home**: Handles the home screen, where users can see recent and recommended experiences, like them, and search. It includes `HomeScreen`, `HomeViewModel`, `SearchExperienceUseCase`, and dependency injection setup.
- **detail**: Manages the detail screen, displaying full experience details and allowing users to like them. It includes `DetailScreen`, `DetailViewModel`, and dependency injection setup.

This modular structure makes the app scalable and easy to maintain.
